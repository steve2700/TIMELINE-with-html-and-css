                   The need to spread Christianity and replace African Traditional Religion which was widely spread among Africans led to the First Chimurenga. The influence of religious leaders such as Mbuya Nehanda, Mlimo and Sekuru Kaguvi who were offering emotional and psychological support to the warriors led to the first Chimurenga.

                        The Africansâ€™ failure in the First Chimurenga forced them to submit themselves to the BSA Company administration. It brought about significant changes to their lives. Defeat meant continuation of the hut tax, effected in 1894, and forced labour on farms, forests and mines among other practices.

                            Many Shona chiefs were killed during the first Chimurenga. The whites replaced these chief which puppet chiefs. African Traditional Religion lost ground to Christianity. Agriculture and trade were severely disrupted. The railway extension reached Harare in 1897. Colonial policies were either strengthened or introduced.
